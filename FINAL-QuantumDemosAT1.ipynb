    "# Visualizing Qubits: The Bloch Sphere\n",
    "We can visualize quantum states using a popular model known as the Bloch sphere. The traditional classical states of 0 and 1 are represented as vertical arrows, and all the many possible \"in-between states\" are represented somewhere else on the sphere. We'll come back to what these other states mean later."
